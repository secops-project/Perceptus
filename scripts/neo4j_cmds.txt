Use the query bellow to load from a CSV file. 
The file must have the following collumns:

id,timestamp,target,action,user,source

---

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM "file:///ssh.csv"
AS line FIELDTERMINATOR ","
MERGE (source:SourceHost { address:line.source })
CREATE (user:UserName { name:line.user, id:line.id, timestamp:line.timestamp })
CREATE (source)-[r1:ATTEMPTED_USER]->(user)
MERGE (action:Action { name:line.action, targetid:line.target})
CREATE (user)-[r2:CAUSED_ACTION]->(action)
MERGE (target:TargetHost { address:line.target })
CREATE (action)-[:ATTEMPTED_TARGET]->(target)

Asset group "Critical" relationship:

MATCH (t:TargetHost {address:"SecOps-sfo01"})
MERGE (t)-[r:MEMBER_OF]->(a:AssetGroup {name:"Critical"})
---

Return a subgraph representing all sources and users who had success login into a target:

MATCH (source)-[:ATTEMPTED_USER]->(user)-[:CAUSED_ACTION]->(action:Action {name:"ssh-login-accepted"})-[:ATTEMPTED_TARGET]->(target) RETURN source,user,action,target

Same as above, but with criticality:

MATCH (source)-[:ATTEMPTED_USER]->(user)-[:CAUSED_ACTION]->(action:Action {name:"ssh-login-accepted"})-[:ATTEMPTED_TARGET]->(target)-[:MEMBER_OF]-> (assetGroup:AssetGroup {name:"Critical"}) RETURN source,user,action,target,assetGroup
